# Because `starwars` is a "hidden" dataset in memory for demonstration, it won't show up in our environment at 
# first, and it'll also be hard to reset it if we make a mistake. So assign it to `df` to make sure you can work
# with it.
df <- starwars

# glimpse turns a data frame on its side. Super useful.
df %>%
  glimpse()
  


# iteratively add operations: 
# height > 100, sex == female, 
# choose name, height, mass, species, films, 
# mass > 50, 
# arrange by mass
# note: filtering on some logical excludes NAs


# calculate a new column,weight_lbs = mass * 2.204623
# Make sure it gets saved to the tibble...



# group and summarize. Pay attention to NAs
# get a count and mean mass by species


# Lots of NAs for average... why? Even for large groups it's NA...


# Humans definitely have SOME mass data...


# so let's exclude NAs from the mean aggregation:



# why does Chagrian have a weird NaN?


# top 5 tallest overall - using slice_head


# or just using slice_max


# what is the shortest character for each species? 




# ALso summarize isn't always the goal what if we want a relative 
# comparison of height for each species? I.e., are you tall for a human?
# calculate tallest for each species without summarizing, convert to percentile, show a few of the columns, sort





# Grouping by multiple
# Was is the average birth year for each gender from each homeworld
